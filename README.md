# Da Vinci Plan Coverage and Medical Formulary Client Reference Implementation

## Installation and Deployment

The client reference implementation can installed and run locally on your machine.  Install the following dependencies first:

* [Ruby 2.6+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Ruby Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

And run the following commands from the terminal:

```sh
# MacOS or Linux
git clone https://github.com/FHIR/dv-formulary-client
cd dv-formulary-client
bundle install
rails s
```

The client can then be accessed at http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.

If you would like to use a different port it can be specified when calling `rails`.  For example, the following command would host the client on port 4000:

```sh
rails s -p 4000
```

### Reference Implementation

While it is recommended that users install the client locally, an instance of the client is hosted at https://formulary-client.herokuapp.com

Users that would like to try out the client before installing locally can use that reference implementation.

## Supported Browsers

The client has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome and Safari.
